# Machine Learning Coursework Portfolio (TTU, 2023)

This repository contains homework, implementations, and project work from my graduate-level Machine Learning coursework covering classical data science, deep learning and scientific machine learning topics.
It includes applied coding exercises, exploratory analysis, algorithm implementations, and end-to-end ML projects in Python.

## Contents
- **Assignments** – structured weekly homework and algorithm implementations  
- **Projects** – midterm and final coursework project  

## Technical Stack
- Python, NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn  
- PyTorch (where applicable)  
- Jupyter Notebooks  
- Matplotlib/Plotly for visualization  

## Highlights
- Classical Machine Learning: Linear & logistic regression, SVMs, k-nearest neighbors, kernel methods, and decision tree–based models.  
- Deep Learning: CNNs, RNNs, ResNets, transfer learning, VAEs, transformers, and GAN architectures. 
- Scientific Machine Learning: Neural differential equations, operator learning, physics-informed models, and data-driven discovery for forward and inverse problems.
